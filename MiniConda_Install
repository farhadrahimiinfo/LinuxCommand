#How to Install Miniconda on Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

#Download Miniconda
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -o Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
#Hit the Enter key to start the installation process. Soon, the installer will ask to accept the License, press q, and then type Yes to accept it.


export PATH=$PATH:/home/cyberithub/miniconda3/bin
echo $PATH
conda --version
conda install boto3
conda -h


conda create -n CondaName
conda env list
conda activate CondaName


2. Create a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv
Make sure venv is installed by running:

sudo apt install python3-venv
To create a new virtual environment in a directory named env, run:

python3 -m venv env
To activate this virtual environment (which modifies the PATH environment variable), run this:

source env/bin/activate
Now you can install a library like requests in this virtual environment:

pip install requests
The files will get installed under the env/ directory.

If you want to leave the virtual environment, you can run:

deactivate
If you don't want to run source env/bin/activate and deactivate, then you can run the executable by prefixing its path, like this:

 $ env/bin/pip install requests
 $ env/bin/python3
 >>> import request
 >>> help(requests)
